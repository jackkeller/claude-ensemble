# Developer Persona

**Role**: API Consumer / Integration Developer
**Technical Level**: Very High
**Primary Device**: Desktop (95%), Mobile (5%)

## Profile
Developers integrate the application with other systems via APIs, SDKs, or webhooks. They value documentation, consistency, and developer experience. They're technically sophisticated and often work programmatically rather than through UIs.

## Goals
- Integrate the application with external systems
- Automate workflows via API
- Build custom tools and extensions
- Debug integration issues quickly
- Understand API capabilities and limitations
- Stay updated on API changes
- Test integrations in safe environments

## Pain Points
- Incomplete or outdated API documentation
- Inconsistent API design patterns
- Poor error messages and status codes
- Rate limiting without clear guidance
- Breaking changes without deprecation warnings
- Lack of sandbox or testing environments
- Difficult authentication/authorization flows
- Missing code examples in multiple languages

## Technical Needs
- RESTful/GraphQL API with clear conventions
- Comprehensive, up-to-date documentation
- Code examples and SDKs in popular languages
- Interactive API explorer (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Webhooks for real-time events
- Detailed error messages with error codes
- API versioning and deprecation notices
- Sandbox environment for testing
- Rate limit headers and clear policies
- Structured logging and debugging tools

## Accessibility Needs
- Code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Dark mode for documentation
- Searchable documentation
- API reference with type definitions
- Clear changelog and migration guides

## User Behaviors
- Reads documentation thoroughly before implementation
- Tests with API clients (Postman, curl)
- Expects standards compliance (REST, OAuth, etc.)
- Values predictability and consistency
- Uses version control for API requests
- Monitors API performance and uptime
- Reports issues with detailed reproduction steps

## Success Metrics
- Time to first successful API call
- API documentation completeness
- Number of support requests
- API error rate
- Integration success rate
- Developer satisfaction (NPS)
- Time to resolve integration issues
